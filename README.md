# Brain-tumor-detection-using-CNN
This project develops an automated system to detect brain tumors from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The CNN extracts features and learns tumor patterns to classify images accurately, enabling faster and reliable diagnosis to assist medical professionals in treatment planning.
